<p><span class="boldheader">Main Idea</span></p>

<!--1.) What does the acronym octad stand for?-->
<span class="underline">What does the acronym OCTAD stands for?</span>

<!--Open Cancer Therapuetic Discovery-->			
<p><span>Open Cancer Therapeutic Discovery</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<!--2.) What does OCTAD do?-->
<span class="underline">What does OCTAD do?</span>
<p><span>The goal of OCTAD is to expedite cancer research for therapies. OCTAD allows users to select their cancer of interest and see which genes and pathways are affected due to the disease. With the LINCS database, we can explore further by predicting potential drugs that may be beneficial against that specific cancer (PMID:28699633). &nbsp;Further evaluation of the drug hits may require bench research for efficacy and/or toxicity testing.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<!--3.) How do I use OCTAD?-->
<span class="underline">How do I use OCTAD?</span>
<p><span>OCTAD is very easy to use. &nbsp;After picking your cancer and filtering down for desired features, you can either manually choose your control samples or use the given default choice that is most correlated to your cancer tissue type. Choose a method of differential expression in the Signature tab and filter down results with the adjusted P value and the number of fold change seen between the case and control samples. Under the Drugs tab, you can choose which database you want to evaluate the potential to reverse the disease signature expression. &nbsp;You can either compute disease signature earlier or submit the job directly. OCTAD will compute disease signature if it detects there is no signature computed. It takes a few minutes to compute disease signature and &nbsp;about two minutes to run drug prediction. You must be logged in to run drug prediction. When the job is complete, an email will be sent to you. A full summary report will be available to review and all data files can be downloaded after the job is complete. You can manage your jobs and check job status by going to the jobs page.</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="boldheader">Databases</span></p>
			
<!--4.) What are the database sources in OCTAD?-->
<span class="underline">What are the database sources used in OCTAD?</span>
<p><span>OCTAD uses patient samples from GTEx, TCGA, St. Jude Hospital, MET 500, and TARGET. &nbsp;Please see our Dataset tab for more information about each data source. 
&nbsp;Our database currently comprises a total of 19128 normal and tumor samples.</span></p><p><span></span></p>

<!--5.) Will the databases be continually updated on OCTAD? Will more samples be added into the database later?-->			
<span class="underline">Will the databases be continually updated on OCTAD? Will more samples be added into the database later on?</span>
<p><span class>Yes. In future version, we plan to include more patient samples. Please contact us if you have datasets you would like to add into OCTAD.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<!--6.) How frequent do you update the database?-->
<span class="underline">How frequent do you update the database?</span>
<p><span>Depends. We have covered the majority of cancers, we will update new large datasets when they are available.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--7.) Are there patterns among the naming samples of IDs?-->
<span class="underline">Are there patterns to the naming of sample IDs?</span></li>
<p><span>Yes, there are a few patterns. Note that these are the original sample IDs from our sources which have their own naming system. &nbsp;For example, from the GTEx source, the samples are name as GTEX-XXXXX-YYYY-SM-ZZZZZ. XXXXX is the patient ID, YYYY is the code for the tissue, and ZZZZZ is the sample aliquot used for sequencing. &nbsp;Please refer to the dataset tab for more info and links to each data source.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--8.) Is there a way to differentiate between-->
<span class="underline">Is there a way to differentiate live and postmortem samples?</span>
<p><span>No, OCTAD does not list which biopsies are postmortem samples. &nbsp;However, the original data sources have that information. &nbsp;GTEx samples are postmortem samples, except some whole blood samples which were collected prior to death. </span></p>

<p><span class="boldheader">Sample Selection Tabs</span></p>

<!--9.) When is the sample size too low to be considered?-->			
<span class="underline">When is the sample size too low?</span>
<p><span>There is no absolute threshold. If the sample size is low, you may not be able to get signature genes that warrant a good prediction. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<!--10.) After filtering the database for samples, my sample size n is less than 5, what should I do?-->
<span class="underline">After filtering the database for samples, my sample size n is less than 5, what should I do?</span>
<p><span>If you could not get enough signature genes (&gt; 100), you may need to change your hypothesis.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--11.) Adding additional mutation features like EGFR, IDH1, ect will give out a NA box. What does the choice NA...-->
<span class="underline">Adding the mutation features like EGFR, IDH1, etc will generate a NA box. What does the NA option mean? Does unchecking the box exclude samples with that mutation? Is picking NA equivalent to not picking that feature at all?</span>
<p><span>Checking the NA box will include samples with unknown status for that mutation and is equivalent to not selecting that feature. &nbsp;Unchecking the NA will exclude those samples. This function is still in the development process.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--12.)How to I interpret the Cancer plot?-->
<span class="underline">How do I interpret the cancer plot? What are the X and Y axes?</span>
<p><span>This t-SNE plot is to show similarity between samples. &nbsp;The closer the points are, the more similar they are in mRNA expression. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--13.) If the distance between points on the t-SNE plot shows similarity, why...-->	
<span class="underline">If the distance between points on the t-SNE plot shows similarity, why do I have a few points relatively far from the main island, even though they are same type of tissue?</span>
<p><span>Those points are either outliers or the samples are mislabeled in the data source. You can remove that sample from your sample set if it is deemed necessary.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<!--14.) I have my own control samples. How do I use my own dataset?-->
<span class="underline">&nbsp;I have my own control samples. How do I use my own dataset?</span>
<p><span>Currently, we DO NOT support users to upload their own data. This function will become available in the next version.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--15.) Can I compare two samples that are not the cancer-normal pairing?-->
<span class="underline">Can I compare two sample types that are not the cancer-normal pairing? Ie. How would I explore the different expression between two cancer types such as colon cancer and rectum cancer? How do I compare adjacent tissue with normal tissue?</span>
<p><span>You are able to manually select other samples as control.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--16.) How do I manually choose my samples?-->
<span class="underline">How do I manually choose my samples?</span>
<p><span>In the sample list, you can manually select samples by checking the ones you want and unchecking the ones you want to exclude in your set.</span></p>

<!--17.) How do I select more than one sample for the control sample?-->			
<span class="underline">How do I select more than one type of tissue for control samples?</span>
<p><span>This feature is not supported in the web portal. Please try OCTAD desktop version which provides more flexibility to choose samples.</span></p>

<!--19.) What are the differences bewtween LINCS database L1000 and L1000 All?-->
<span class="underline">What are the differences between the LINCS databases L1000 and L1000 All?</span><p><span>L1000 uses only 978 landmark genes in the prediction (other 22 genes are used as control). L1000 All include the imputed expression of the remaining transcriptome. By default, L1000 is used.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
			
<!--20.) What number should I put in for "max genes on one side"? What does it mean?-->
<span class="underline">What number should I input for &ldquo;max genes on One side&rdquo;? And what does it mean?</span>
<p><span>Sometimes, we have to limit the number of disease signature to compute reversal correlation. Empirical analysis suggested 50 is good for L1000.</span></p>
